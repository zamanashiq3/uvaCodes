# uvaCodes
my uva submitted solutions

assign_qbit's solution binge stared in the March 2016. I was told that I need to make a rich profife in UVA,thus the project started. 

Most of the solutions I made were in java, but for some bullshit reason some of it got RE and I've to re-write the solution in c++11, so that it gets an AC, so if not any source code found but saying solved in uva board it's probably in c++11. 


I lost/fogot my previous account, there I solved 80+ porblems in ANSI C/C++11, but now I solved all of those in Java/C++11. 

for any quiries, mail at-
